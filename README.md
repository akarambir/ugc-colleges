#Extracting college names, address from UGC site

*Author: Karambir Singh Nain*

This include a python script which I made to extract college names from ugc main site. It uses reguler expressions. 
It outputs a file name colleges.txt with all college names and address. I am able to extract 7758 colleges from 8000 in the list. Most which I couldn't extract were bad data entries in UGC's site. 

I wanted to practice Rgex a bit. 

**It can also be done with string find methods.**

##Requirements:

1. UrlLib2 - for downloading html files from usc website.

2. Re - regular expressions module.

If you have any query, give a pull request.
